## What's the issue?

By 2035, Pulau Semakau will be filled. In 20 years, plastic waste will triple from the current amount. Yet, Singaporeâ€™s domestic recycling rate has fallen from 17% in 2019 to 13% in 2020. Although 6 in 10 households recycle regularly, the lack of proper practice in handling rubbish has resulted in ineffective recycling processes.

## How are we solving it?

RecycleGoWhere hopes to make recycling simple and easy with a click of a button. Through our app, you can arrange for a driver to pick up your recyclables. With that you turn your recyclables into points that can be exchanged to Grab points! You can even track how much you have recycled and how much carbon offset you have achieved.
